        <Description>
          I specialize in creating web applications with React. My goal is to
          deliver high-quality, seamless user experiences. While my main focus
          is on front-end development, I also have solid experience with
          back-end technologies like NestJs and Python. Check out my mobile
          application project developed with React Native on my GitHub profile.
          Itâ€™s a testament to my versatility and ability to adapt to different
          technologies.
