          I specialize in creating web applications with React. My goal is to
          deliver high-quality, seamless user experiences. While my main focus
          is on front-end development, I also have solid experience with
          back-end technologies like NestJs and Python. <br /> <br />
          Check out my mobile application project developed with React Native on
          my GitHub profile. Itâ€™s a testament to my versatility and ability to
          adapt to different technologies.
